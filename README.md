# FileSystem-Minishell
The  project has to simulate a linux shell script , the commands are related to FileSystem (mkdir, touch , rm , rmdir , ls , cd , etc.). Once you run the project , everything is interactive . The user receives feedback in real time.   This project was implemented using Linked Lists .


It helps you to understand how to work with lists and structures overall , a lot of base cases  , it makes you to think about all possible cases.
It was fun to implement it.
